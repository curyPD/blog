# Blog website

This is my first attempt at putting together a full-stack application (React + Firebase).
I'm not very serious about blogging for now, this is more of a practice project.
The site lacks several features I was initially planning on implementing, so I'm going to keep working on it.

### Features yet to add:

- Google auth😎 --------------------> ✅
- Leaving likes under posts💚 ------> ⏳
- Writing comments✉ ----------------> ⏳
- Editing posts (for admin)📝 ------> ✅
- Deleting posts (for admin)🚮 -----> ✅
- Improve existing features👷‍♂️ ------> ✅

The blog is about language learning, by the way

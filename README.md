# Polyglot Dreamâœ¨ blog website

This website is my first attempt at creating a full-stack web application (without having to write a single line of backend codeðŸ™‚). Stack: React + Firebase + TailwindCSS.

## Features

- Email+Password and Google sign-in options
- Leaving likes and comments under posts for authenticated users
- Admin dashboard for viewing, creating, editing and deleting posts
- Firebase Realtime Database is used to store all post data and user roles
- Post images are stored in Cloud Storage for Firebase
